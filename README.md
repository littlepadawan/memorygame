## Motivation

This memory game is the third project in the Front End Web Development nanodegree at Udacity. I was given some starter code (HTML and CSS) displaying a static version of the game and my task has been to convert that to an interactive one. To acheive this, the main part of the project has been revolved around building the JavaScript file, but I have also modified the HTM Land CSS files to some extent.

## How to use?

To use this project, all you need to do is open it up and start playing. Click a pair of cards and you're up and running!

## Credits
I would like to thank everyone who has helped me figure this project out, especially the people at the coding community Castle Coding in Stockholm and Kim Pettersson who is a fellow student at Udacity.
